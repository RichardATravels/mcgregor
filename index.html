            <p>Conor Anthony McGregor (born 14 July 1988) is an Irish professional mixed
                martial artist and boxer. He is the former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight and lightweight
                champion. He has also competed as a welterweight in mixed martial arts (MMA), and light middleweight
                in boxing. He is #3 on the UFC's pound for pound rankings. McGregor started his MMA career in 2008 and,
                in 2012, he won both the Cage Warriors Featherweight and Lightweight Championships, holding both titles simultaneously
                before vacating them to sign with the UFC. In 2015, at UFC 194, he defeated Jos√© Aldo for the UFC Featherweight
                Championship via knockout thirteen seconds into the first round, which is the fastest victory in UFC title
                fight history. Upon defeating Eddie Alvarez for the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 205, McGregor
                became the first fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two weight divisions simultaneously. McGregor
                began his professional boxing career in 2017. In his debut boxing match, he was defeated by Floyd Mayweather
                Jr.. McGregor is the biggest pay-per-view (PPV) draw in MMA history, having headlined four out of the
                six highest-selling UFC pay-per-view events. His headline bout with Nate Diaz at UFC 202 drew 1.65 million
                PPV buys, the most ever for an MMA event. His boxing match with Mayweather drew 4.3 million PPV buys
                in North America, the second most in history</p>
